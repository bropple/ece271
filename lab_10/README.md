Post-lab Questions
-------
1) PA1 Voltage: 2V
   DR Value: 0x0CDC
   Using the equation in the lab, Vref=2.49 V

2) The constant to compare with is 1300.

3) I compared this to 1600.

4) About 5 inches.

5) The textbook can be hard to understand at times. More in-depth in-class reviews of the code for labs (after the due
date, of course) would be incredibly helpful for a deeper understanding of the textbook code and the overall processes
used to make the lab work on the ST board.
