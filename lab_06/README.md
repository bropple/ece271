What is your something cool?
The LCD Counts the number of seconds that have passed since the program started, using the systick function.

Post-lab Questions
1) See the something cool part

2) The Systick Interrupt is #15, as stated in the ARM Cortex M4 Manual (the ISR_NUMBER).

3) By default, the SysTick_IRQn is set to a value of -1, but this can be changed by the user.
   A higher priority value means a lower urgency, the interrupts with the lower number are executed first.

4) It is enabled by default, but it must be configured in order to be used in a program.
