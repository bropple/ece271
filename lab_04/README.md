Summary of Lab Status
-------
- [X] Pre-lab Assignment (2 points) 
- [X] Basic in-lab assignments (15 points) 
- [X] Something cool (3 points): Keypad 

What is your something cool?
You can input the amount of degrees you want and the motor will rotate that amount.

Post-lab Questions
To increase the motor speed, you can decrease the amount of time in the delay.

To change the motor's direction, you can perform all of the steps in reverse order.

1) To increase current, you can have multiple darlington arrays in parallel (from TI's website).

2) It is possible with microstepping, but it takes more code to do so. For example, like how
half-stepping takes twice the amount of code as full-stepping.
