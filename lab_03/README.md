Summary of Lab Status
-------
- [X] Pre-lab Assignment (2 points) 
- [X] Basic in-lab assignments (15 points) 
- [-] Something cool (3 points): Could not figure out

What is your something cool?
I tried to make the # key repeat the last input, but I kept getting errors, and Keil would not
tell me what they actually were.

Post-lab Questions
1) My algorithm only prints out the first key it detects as 'pressed'. It cannot detect multiple
keys at a time.
2) If more time was spent in class discussing how the keypad works, I think that would be the greatest
improvement, experience-wise.
3) I didn't see any typos in the textbook.

Lab Credits
-------
* Did you received any help from someone other than Prof. Zhu and lab teaching assistants?
Spencer and Jason heloed me out with the keypad.

Suggestions and Comments
-------
* Report typos, errors, or suggestions into the "typos" session on piazza site (https://piazza.com/maine/spring2018/ece271)
* I offer one dollar each new typo or error in the 3rd edition.
